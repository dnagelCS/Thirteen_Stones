* 2 players take turns in choosing how many stones to take out of the pile. 
* They can choose to erase 1, 2, or 3 stones. 
* Whichever player clears the pile completely loses that round.
* A scoreboard keeps track of how many wins each player has.

Another Material Card View is used for the buttons 1, 2, and 3.  

The image of the 13 stones gets updated with the correct drawable depending on the amount of stones left in the pile.
